# Exam-Cell-Automation

# Abstract :

The Examination Hall System is a PHP project that can automate the process of exam allotment and seating arrangement. The system was developed using the following languages: PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQLi, and jQuery.

The system facilitates the examination by assigning each student to their respected classes and allocating the seating arrangement to avoid conflict. Most of the time student faces problems finding their assign examination hall, so with this system, it will be easier to manage the location by arranging each hall in a computer-generated way. This is very useful for colleges whereas it can generate a report that concerned the students.

The system has a feature that generates a report automatically during exams at the end of the session or in between the session.
